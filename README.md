### Software developer | Scrum master | Front end specialist | ANGULAR - REACT - REACT NATIVE - AGILE

Passionate developer with an eye on project management, in love with Javascript (mostly Typescript).

Currently working on professional dashboard configurators focused on industry 4.0,
warehouse managament systems UIs and 3D visualization of real-time data.

On my free time i keep myself updated and experiment new technologies and try to develop my ideas with a group of friends. Some are outstanding developers, some are juniors taught by me.

I love teaching and managing alongside developing code. In fact in my free time i manage the group in an agile-like way, to reach the goals we decided together making every single hour count! (we have really little free time!)

Much part of my free time is dedicated to my family. The most important project i've been involved in my life.
